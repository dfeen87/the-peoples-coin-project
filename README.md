## Project Overview

The People's Coin backend serves as the resilient core of the platform, responsible for securely recording, validating, and managing acts of goodwill contributed by users across a global network.

The system is built on PostgreSQL 15 for durable, scalable data storage and exposes a RESTful Flask API for managing:

- **User accounts and wallets** — Secure authentication and balance tracking
- **Goodwill actions and balances** — Recording and validating acts of kindness
- **Proposals and governance workflows** — Democratic decision-making processes
- **Council membership and oversight structures** — Leadership and accountability

Every interaction is validated, persistently stored, and made available for auditing, ensuring transparency, integrity, and long-term reliability as system load increases.

## System Controller

At the center of the backend is the System Controller, an intelligent orchestration layer designed to monitor and adapt backend behavior based on real-world conditions.

The controller continuously observes:

- CPU utilization
- Memory usage
- Disk availability
- Task queue depth (when available)

It analyzes both real-time metrics and historical workload data stored in the database to generate data-driven recommendations. These recommendations may include adjusting background worker counts or scaling deployment replicas when running in a containerized environment.

All recommendations and actions are recorded, enabling traceability and post-hoc analysis.

---

## What You Can Build With This Backend Today

This backend is intentionally generic and modular. It can be used immediately as:

- **A governance and voting backend** for communities, DAOs, or cooperatives (proposals, councils, decision tracking)
- **A contribution or reputation ledger** to record, score, and audit non-financial actions (volunteer work, moderation, civic engagement)
- **A backend template for civic or nonprofit platforms** requiring transparency, auditability, and long-term data integrity
- **A system orchestration experiment** demonstrating intelligent resource monitoring and adaptive scaling via a centralized controller
- **A research platform** for studying incentive alignment, governance dynamics, and system resilience under load
- **A foundation for tokenized or non-tokenized reward systems**, independent of any specific blockchain or frontend

The system is designed to run locally, in containers, or in cloud environments, with optional Redis and Kubernetes integration depending on deployment needs.

---

FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here

# Security
RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your_recaptcha_site_key
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=your_recaptcha_secret_key
```

#### Optional Variables

```bash
# Redis (for task queuing and caching)
CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0

# Observability Node
OBSERVABILITY_PORT=8080
OBSERVABILITY_HOST=0.0.0.0

# Kubernetes (for auto-scaling)
KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE=default
KUBERNETES_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=peoples-coin-backend
MIN_REPLICAS=1
MAX_REPLICAS=10

# Google Cloud (if using Cloud Run or Firebase)
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/credentials.json
INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME=project:region:instance

# RabbitMQ (alternative to Redis)
RABBITMQ_URL=amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/
```

### Running the Application

#### Option 1: Local Development

```bash
# Run the Flask API server
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8080

# Or using the app directly
python peoples_coin/app.py

# In a separate terminal, run the System Controller (optional)
python peoples_coin/start_background.py
```

#### Option 2: Using Docker Compose

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build

# Run in detached mode
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop all services
docker-compose down
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

#### Option 3: Run Observability Node Separately

**Important:** Configure a different port when running alongside the main API to avoid conflicts:

```bash
# The observability node uses port 8080 by default
# Change this if the main API is also using port 8080
export OBSERVABILITY_PORT=8081

# Start the observability node for monitoring
python -m observability_node.run

# Or
cd observability_node
python app.py
```

The observability node will be available at the configured port (e.g., `http://localhost:8081`).

- System logs complement persistent audit records
- Comprehensive audit trails for all user actions
- Real-time monitoring through the Observability Node

---

## API Documentation

The People's Coin backend uses **Flasgger** for automatic API documentation generation.

### Accessing API Docs

Once the application is running, you can access the interactive API documentation at:

```
http://localhost:8080/apidocs
```

The Swagger UI provides:
- **Interactive API testing** — Try out endpoints directly from the browser
- **Request/Response schemas** — See exactly what data structures are expected
- **Authentication flows** — Test secured endpoints with API keys
- **Model definitions** — Explore database models and their relationships

### Key API Endpoints

The backend exposes several categorized endpoint groups:

- **Authentication** (`/auth/*`) — User login, registration, and session management
- **User Management** (`/api/users/*`) — User profiles and account operations
- **Goodwill Actions** (`/api/goodwill/*`) — Submit and track acts of kindness
- **Governance** (`/api/governance/*`) — Proposals, voting, and council operations
- **Blockchain** (`/api/blockchain/*`) — Chain validation and block management
- **Metabolic System** (`/api/metabolic/*`) — Resource allocation and system health
- **Immune System** (`/api/immune/*`) — Content moderation and reporting
- **Status & Health** (`/status/*`) — System health checks and monitoring

For detailed endpoint documentation, refer to the Swagger UI after starting the server.

## Global Observability Node

The Global Observability Node is a lightweight, read-only REST API that provides safe, non-intrusive access to internal system state. This observability layer enables external monitoring without affecting system behavior.

### Key Features

- **Read-Only Access**: All endpoints are GET-only. POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests are rejected with 405 Method Not Allowed.
- **Safe Monitoring**: No write operations, no database modifications, no controller actions triggered.
- **Independent Operation**: Can run as a standalone service (configure port to avoid conflicts with main API).
- **Thread-Safe**: Uses read-only database queries and snapshot-based metrics.

### Endpoints

#### 1. GET /health
Returns basic service liveness, uptime, and version information.

#### 2. GET /api/system_state
Returns comprehensive system metrics including CPU, memory, disk, database activity, Redis queue depth, Kubernetes status, and last controller evaluation.

#### 3. GET /api/controller_decisions
Returns recent controller decisions, scaling recommendations, and actions taken.

#### 4. GET /api/governance_state
Returns high-level governance metadata including proposal counts, vote totals, and council membership.

#### 5. GET /api/audit_summary
Returns recent audit log entries including event types, timestamps, and context.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Set required environment variables
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost/dbname"
export OBSERVABILITY_PORT=8080  # Optional

# Run the observability node
python -m observability_node.run

# Or run directly
cd observability_node && python app.py
```

For complete documentation, examples, and deployment options, see [observability_node/QUICKSTART.md](observability_node/QUICKSTART.md).

## Kubernetes Integration

When deployed in a Kubernetes environment, the System Controller can integrate directly with the cluster API to manage replica scaling.

Key characteristics:

- Scaling operates within configured minimum and maximum bounds
- Deployment name, namespace, and limits are environment-driven
- Secure, authorized API access is required

If Kubernetes is not present, the controller continues monitoring without attempting automated scaling.

---

## Monitoring & Logging

System health data is collected using psutil, providing visibility into:

- CPU load
- Memory consumption
- Disk utilization

The controller supplements these metrics by querying recent database activity and, when available, Redis queue backlogs. Each evaluation cycle logs:

- Observed system state
- Scaling recommendations
- Actions taken (or intentionally skipped)

This design supports transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement of scaling heuristics.

---

## Testing

The project includes a test suite to ensure code quality and reliability.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_observability_node.py

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=peoples_coin --cov-report=html
```

### Test Structure

The test suite covers:
- **Unit tests** — Individual component functionality
- **Integration tests** — Database interactions and API endpoints
- **Observability tests** — Monitoring and metrics collection
- **Import tests** — Module dependencies and configurations

Tests are located in the `/tests` directory and follow standard pytest conventions.

---

## Biological Inspiration

The People's Coin backend is intentionally inspired by biological systems, particularly the human nervous, immune, and endocrine systems.

- Continuous sensing of internal state
- Adaptive responses to environmental stressors
- Maintenance of equilibrium under variable load

In this analogy, the System Controller functions as a central nervous system, interpreting signals and coordinating responses to maintain system health. This biomimetic approach informs both architectural decisions and long-term evolution of the platform.

---

## Technologies & Tools

- **Flask** — Web framework
- **PostgreSQL 15** — Primary datastore
- **SQLAlchemy** — ORM and schema management
- **Docker / Docker Compose** — Containerization
- **Redis (optional)** — Queue management
- **psutil** — System monitoring
- **APScheduler** — Periodic job scheduling
- **Kubernetes Python Client (optional)** — Deployment orchestration

All optional components degrade gracefully when unavailable.

## Benefits of Cloning This Repository

Cloning this repository gives you a practical, inspectable backend foundation that you can run and adapt quickly:

- Full access to a modular Flask + SQLAlchemy architecture you can reuse for governance, reputation, or civic platforms.
- A ready-to-evolve data model covering accounts, wallets, goodwill actions, proposals, votes, and audit logs.
- Built-in observability and adaptive system-controller logic to experiment with workload-aware backend behavior.
- Container and infrastructure manifests (Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes) to test locally and transition to cloud deployments.
- Migration scripts and tests that make iterative development and schema evolution easier to manage.
- Optional integrations (Redis, Kubernetes) that degrade gracefully, allowing development without a full production stack.

---

## Development & Production Readiness

The backend is designed with operational resilience in mind:

- Works with or without Redis and Kubernetes
- Scaling actions are bounded to prevent resource thrashing
- All automated decisions are logged and auditable
- Modular structure supports incremental extension

This provides a stable foundation for continued development and future production hardening.
